# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Bagging-Classifier
Developed a predictive model using Scikit-learn to classify diabetes cases based on medical data.
Preprocessed data by handling missing values, standardizing features, and splitting it into training and test sets.
Implemented a Decision Tree classifier as a baseline model and improved performance using Bagging ensemble learning.
Evaluated model accuracy using cross-validation and improved generalization using ensemble techniques.
